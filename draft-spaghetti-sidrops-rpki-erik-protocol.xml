        This document specifies the Erik Synchronization Protocol for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
        Erik Synchronization can be characterized as a data replication system using Merkle trees, a content-addressable naming scheme, concurrency control using monotonically increasing sequence numbers, and HTTP transport.
        Relying Parties can combine information retrieved via Erik Synchronization with other RPKI transport protocols.
        The protocol's design is intended to be efficient, fast, easy to implement, and robust in the face of partitions or faults in the network.

        <t>
          The notion of cache-to-cache data replication of unvalidated data was documented in <xref target="RFC7115" section="3"/>.
        </t>
        <blockquote quotedFrom="RFC7115, section 3">
          <t>
             Validated caches may also be created and maintained from other validated caches.
             Network operators SHOULD take maximum advantage of this feature to minimize load on the global distributed RPKI database.
             Of course, the recipient relying parties should re-validate the data.
          </t>
        </blockquote>

        <t>
          Historic records show that experiments have been performed in this space using, for example, peer-to-peer file sharing technology (see <xref target="P2P"/>), but no standardised and widely-deployed mechanism for cache-to-cache replication emerged since then.
          The authors hope that the Erik Synchronization protocol might be suitable to fill this gap and improve propagation speed of validly signed repository data as well as help reduce load on the global RPKI.

      <t>
        Erik Synchronisation is an architecture to reliably distribute RPKI repository data from cache to cache using so-called Erik relays.
        Relays maintain a validated cache themselves and can be clients of other relays.
        The collective convergence of a group of relays can be interpreted as an instance of a <xref target="Paxos"/> protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        In this synchronization protocol, Merkle trees are used to determine whether differences exist between client and relay.
        Merkle trees are hierarchical data structures: the hash value of each node is computed recursively by hashing the concatenated hash values of the node's children.
        The hash of the ErikIndex represents the entire dataset related to a given FQDN.
        If the ErikIndex hash is not the same between two replicas, the relay provides the client with hashes of smaller and smaller portions of the to-be-replicated dataset until the exact list of out-of-sync or missing objects is identified.
        Sequence numbers are then used to determine whether these differences are relevant enough for the client to fetch.
        All data, except for ErikIndex objects, is fetched using static addresses derived from object hashes.
        This approach reduces unnecessary data transfer between caches which contain mostly similar data.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client starts by querying an Erik relay for the relay's current ErikIndex for a given FQDN.
        If the ErikIndex is different compared to the previous run (or compared to the Index calculated from the locally cached objects).
        With the ErikIndex in hand, the client can determine which ErikParitions are missing and fetch accordingly.
        The client then can compare the <em>manifestNumber</em> sequence number and <em>thisUpdate</em> for each manifest listed in the ErikPartition, and proceed to fetch (purportedly) newer versions of manifests of interest.
        Whenever a relay has manifests with a lower sequence number on offer, the client can ignore those.
        The client now has sufficient information to proceed to fetch any missing Certificates, Signed objects, and CRLs.
        With the information contained within manifests, clients can fetch addressed by content (by hash) and store by name (or some other scheme).

        A snapshot contains all RPKI objects a relay associated with a given FQDN as of the time of the snapshot's production.
        Snapshots do not contain ErikIndex or ErikPartition objects.

        The client MUST calculate the hashes of fetched objects and verify they are the same as the expected hashes (which are embedded in the URIs through which the objects were retrieved).
        If there is a hash mismatch, the client may try fetching the object from a different Erik relay or treat this as a <em>failed fetch</em> (see <xref target="RFC9286" section="6.6"/>) and try again at a later point in time in a next validation run.

        Erik relays can be operated by any party, without permission from or coordination with publication point operators or CAs.
        Relays are made accessible via either HTTP or HTTPS or both.
      </t>
      <t>
        Relays generate and make accessible ErikIndexes and ErikPartitions derived from their current validation state, the client then cherry-picks which objects (if any) it wishes to fetch.
        In turn, relays fetch fresh data from other relays, or from CA-designated publication points accessible via Rsync (<xref target="RFC5781"/>) and RRDP (<xref target="RFC8182"/>).

          Design notes: a decision must be made on a deterministic "manifest-to-partition" assignment scheme.
          Job's proof-of-concept relay (see <xref target="running_code"/>) uses the first few octets of the the Manifest's AKI as a stable partition assignment scheme.
          Other strategies could be to assign manifests to ErikPartitions based on the "hour-of-day" of the CMS signing timestamp, or the first few octets of the SHA-256 of the manifest object.

      <name>Comparison with other RPKI transport protocols</name>

      <t>
        Ignoring obvious mechanical "on the wire" differences between Erik, Rsync, and RRDP; there are a number of concept differences between the protocols.
        Rsync and RRDP can be described as "general purpose" synchronisation protocols: they could be used to transfer any arbitrary set of files, on the other hand the Erik protocol is RPKI-specific: part of its signaling layer are RPKI manifest objects, which RPs require as recourse for validation anyway.
        This property by itself causes a small deduplication in the data to be transferered.
      </t>

      <section>
        <name>Comparison with Rsync</name>
        <t>
          In Rsync, the server and the client construct and transfer a full listing of all available objects, and then transfer objects as necessary.
          In effect, this allows clients to 'jump' to the latest repository state, regardless of the state of the local cache.
        </t>
        <t>
          A major downside of Rsync is that the list of files itself can become a burden to transfer.
          As of June 2025, in order to merely establish whether a client is synchronized or not with the RIPE NCC repository at <tt>rpki.ripe.net</tt>, as much as 5.8 megabytes of data are exchanged without exchanging any RPKI data.
        </t>
        <t>
          Experimentation suggests that when synchronizing once an hour, Erik consumes less network traffic than Rsync generally would consume which, in turn, is less network traffic than RRDP would.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section>
        <name>Comparison with RRDP</name>
        <t>
          The key concept in RRDP is that the client downloads a "journal", containing all add/update/delete operations and replays this journal to arrive at the current repository state.
        </t>
        <t>
          A major downside of RRDP is that (depending on the RRDP polling interval) clients end up downloading data which has become outdated.
          Imagine a hypothetical CA which issues and revokes a ROA every 10 minutes and a client that synchronizes every 60 minutes; in effect the client must fetch 5 outdated states, wasting bandwidth.
        </t>
        <t>
          Experimentation suggests that when synchronizing every 15 minutes, Erik consumes less network traffic than RRDP generally would consume which, in turn, is less network traffic than Rsync would consume.
        </t>

        <section>
          <name>Garbage Collection</name>
          <t>
            In contrast to RRDP, the Erik protocol has no concept of server-specific "stateful" sessions that persist across polling attempts.
            This obviates the need for <tt>withdraw</tt> instructions as part of the protocol exchange: clients can simply delete objects that are no longer referenced from their current validation state and refetch them later on if needed.

      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>
        As of July 2025, the global Internet's RPKI churn rate appears to be 2 new objects per second.
        The ecosystem is estimated to be composed of ~ 5000 RPKI cache instances and ~ 50 repository servers.
        Assuming 10 minute fetching intervals and 150 metadata requests per synchronization run (for exchange of Merkle tree data), an Erik relay serving all the Internet's RPKI cache instances would probably need to be able to sustain serving an average of at least 11,000 HTTP requests per second.
        This order of magnitude in terms of scaling requirements can easily be handled by a single commodity server.

    <section anchor="security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        This document makes no changes to RPKI certificate validation procedures.
      </t>
      <t>
        Paraphrasing <xref target="RFC6810" section="11"/>:
        The RPKI relies on object, not server or transport, trust.
        That is, the Regional Internet Registry root trust anchors are distributed through some out-of-band means, and can then be used by each relying party to validate certificate chains and Signed Objects.
        The inter-cache relationships are based on this object security model; hence, any cache-to-cache transport is assumed to be unreliable at times.
      </t>
      <t>
        See <xref target="RFC8182" section="5"/> for applicable security considerations.
      </t>
      <t>
        Byzantine events or faults in relay-to-client communication can be resolved by the client rotating requests for objects among different Erik relays, using either HTTP or HTTPS.

        This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
        The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
        Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
        Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
        This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
        Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.

      <t>
        According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
        It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".
